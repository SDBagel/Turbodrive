Seamlessly integrate Microsoft 365 & GSuite for Education.

## The Problem
I'm a person who has and vastly prefers Microsoft 365 (Word, Powerpoint, etc), but my school district uses GSuite. Unfortunately, GSuite suffers a number of frustrating issues - losing access without a network, offline apps that just don't compare to Microsoft, unwieldy cloud sync, slow sites, subpar features, and in my opinion, a UI/UX that leaves something to be desired.

## Scope
Both Microsoft 365 and GSuite offer APIs and I'm hoping that I'll be able to integrate the two into something that makes more sense for students.

The goal is to make:
- A streamlined Google Classroom UI / Dashboard
- Simplify the transition between Office and Classroom/Drive
- Automatically download/upload assignments between Classroom/Drive and Office

## Stuff I'd Like But...
This is stuff that might be cool but might never happen.
- Integrate Microsoft To Do and both Google/Microsoft Calendar
- Class/course reviews for course selection time
- Chat/DMs for classmates directly (Chat/Teams?)
- Integration with non-Google/non-Microsoft products
